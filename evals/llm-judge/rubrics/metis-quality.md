## Intent Analysis (1-5)

- 1: Misunderstood the user's request entirely
- 2: Partially understood but missed key aspects
- 3: Understood the main intent but missed nuances or implicit requirements
- 4: Good understanding of intent including implicit requirements
- 5: Precisely captured the user's intent, identified implicit requirements, and flagged ambiguities

## Ambiguity Detection (1-5)

- 1: No ambiguities identified even when obvious ones exist
- 2: Identified surface-level ambiguities only
- 3: Identified some ambiguities but missed important ones
- 4: Identified most ambiguities with reasonable resolution suggestions
- 5: Identified all ambiguities, categorized by impact, and proposed resolution strategies

## Constraint Identification (1-5)

- 1: No constraints or dependencies identified
- 2: Identified obvious constraints only
- 3: Some constraints identified but missing non-obvious ones
- 4: Good constraint identification including cross-cutting concerns
- 5: Comprehensive constraint mapping including technical, architectural, and operational constraints
